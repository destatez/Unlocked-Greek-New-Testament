# Unlocked Greek New Testament

The objectives of this project are to provide a Greek New Testament that:

  - Is **free of copyright and licensing restrictions** (public domain / CC0), permitting the entire global Church to use and build on it without hindrance.
  - Is **based on existing work** of excellent pedigree and academic repute.
  - Is **morphologically parsed** and **lexically tagged**.
