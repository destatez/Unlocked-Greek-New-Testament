# Unlocked Greek New Testament

The objectives of this project are to provide a Greek New Testament that:

  - Is **free of copyright and licensing restrictions** (CC BY-SA), permitting the entire global Church to use and build on it without hindrance.
  - Is **based on existing work** of excellent pedigree and academic repute.
  - Is **morphologically parsed** and **lexically tagged**.


## Description

The text has been prepared by Alan Bunning. For manuscript transcriptions and a full explanation of the project, see www.greekcntr.org.

UGNT will be morphologically tagged.

UGNT will be lexically tagged both to Strong's and the [UGL][ugl].
